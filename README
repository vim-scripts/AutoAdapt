DESCRIPTION
This plugin automatically adapts information like "last modified" timestamps
and copyright notices, or applies any other substitution before each file
save. Where and what is replaced can be configured globally and for each
individual buffer.

The plugin ships with configuration defaults which handle the most common
copyright notices, e.g.:
    Copyright: (C) 2011-2013 Ingo Karkat
and modification timestamps such as
    Last Change: Mon 08 Jul 2013 09:36:03 CET
    Modified: 2013 Jul 08

SOURCE
- The regular expression for updating copyright notices is derived from
    http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Automatically_Update_Copyright_Notice_in_Files

RELATED WORKS
- ferallastchange.vim (vimscript #680) is an old plugin that searches for a
  prefix and then updates the timestamp in a certain format.
- timstamp.vim (vimscript #371) takes pattern and replacement parts like this
  plugin (the replacement part also supports some custom tokens e.g. for
  hostname), and is functionally very close.
- timestamp.vim (vimscript #923) is based on timstamp.vim. It allows only one
  pattern and feeds the replacement part to strftime(), making it less
  general.
- lastmod.vim (vimscript #3578) is a short and simple plugin for replacing one
  pattern with a timestamp in the first N lines.

USAGE
The adaptation happens before every buffer save (BufWritePre event), e.g.
with the :write command. No action required. You can configure
(g:AutoAdapt_Rules) and disable this, though:

:NoAutoAdapt            Turn off automatic adapting for the current buffer.
